Planning for cost-effective conservation requires reliable estimates of land costs, spatially-differentiated at high resolution. Nolte (2020) provides an estimation approach that dramatically improves estimates for undeveloped land. Much undeveloped land of conservation interest is under threat of conversion to agricultural use or is already agricultural. Here we improve on the accuracy and coverage of estimation models for such land by incorporating additional variables known to affect agricultural land value and by modeling at scales corresponding to regional agricultural markets. We find that median home value, climatic variables, and several soil type variables contribute substantially to predictive power. Our estimates improve accuracy by X percent on average and extend coverage by 31\% percent. %31 comes from the added # of counties in FRR compared to county models

\section{Introduction}

Agencies and private organizations designing conservation efforts must contend with the fundamental scarcity of available resources, while simultaneously confronting a vast array of potential conservation strategies. Accurately predicting costs of competing strategies, then, is crucial to achieving the cost-effective use of scarce conservation dollars. The value of land is the primary determinant of such costs. Yet, academics and planners have not often had access to reliable estimates of fair market land value, which constitute a high-priority resource for global change science and policy in general \cite{Coomes2018GeospatialPolicy} . Some studies have relied on state or county-wide average land value estimates (e.g., \cite{Withey2012MaximisingUSA}; \cite{Lawler2020PlanningConfiguration}),
which obscure important heterogeneity of land values across those geographically large political units. Recent work suggests that conservation strategies based on such low-resolution cost estimates can substantially underestimate the cost of selected plans (\cite{Nolte2020High-resolutionStates}). 

Several studies have attempted more accurate, higher-resolution land value estimates with national coverage. One uses a patchwork of USDA county-level agricultural land value estimates and existing hedonic estimates of urban land value (\cite{Kuminoff2013}) to interpolate values to a mix of parcels, census tracts, and counties across the contiguous U.S. (\cite{Larson2015}). Another estimates urban land values for every Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in the U.S. (\cite{Albouy2018}). For each MSA, they leverage sales data from the CoStar COMPS database to estimate land value per acre as a continuous function of distance from the city center. The majority of conservation interest, of course, lies outside of urban areas. With a primary focus on undeveloped land, Nolte (2020) integrates a nationwide database of parcel-specific information, including location, built environment, local demographics, and physical landscape features, with Zillow’s ZTRAX database of millions of sales records for use in a machine-learning algorithm to estimate land values at much higher spatial resolution. These estimates explain a much greater portion of observed variation in sales value than county-wide averages. The Nolte approach constitutes a leap forward for estimating the value of undeveloped land value for conservation planning. As we show here, it can be further improved.

To better inform conservation planning and management, analyses must treat agricultural land specifically. Such land is a primary target for conservation advocates, either as a bulwark against further development or to recover natural ecosystems from degrading intensive agricultural practices, such as deforestation (\cite{busch2020}) and water pollution (\cite{lupi2020}; \cite{michalak2013}). Because farmland exhibits distinct valuation dynamics compared to other land use types, appraisals that do not address agricultural property as a unique entity may fail to accurately portray the costs of bringing agricultural and other arable land under the aegis of regulatory agencies or non-profits like The Nature Conservancy. The massive scope of Nolte (2020)'s analysis does not allow for a distinct treatment of agricultural land value.

Alongside an attention to such unique facets of agricultural land value, there is reason to believe that expanding both the set of agriculturally and economically relevant predictors as well as the geographic scale of analysis could improve the coverage and quality of land value estimates. The market value of undeveloped land is in many cases driven by the value of its actual or potential use in agriculture. It can also be driven by demand in related, residential land markets. Climate and soil variables, heretofore absent from the list of Nolte predictors, are well known to be important determinants of agricultural productivity and land value [citations]. Irrigation can also be an important determinant of productivity for particular crops and geographies, though it requires costly investment. The irrigation status of land can indicate unobserved investments in machinery, infrastructure or physical changes to land that enhance its market value. 

While many of the land quality attributes that determine economic value are fixed, or change only very slowly over time, many drivers of supply and demand—income, preferences, technology, and the availability of substitutes---vary over time. Home price indices capture changing dynamics in residential land markets that can exert pressure on (or otherwise correlate with) the price of undeveloped land. Accounting for variation in local home prices might thus improve the predictive power of models aimed at estimating the value of agricultural or other undeveloped land. 

In addition to incorporating additional predictors, we consider the possibility that modeling at scales larger than the county can ease local observation constraints, improving both the coverage and accuracy of resulting estimates. Many counties have few sales records in the ZTRAX database. Nolte (2020) implements a 1000-observation minimum for modeling county land values, supplementing a focal county’s observations with observations drawn from neighboring counties where possible. Even with this supplementation procedure, 27\% percent of counties fail to meet the threshold, and prediction accuracies for counties with sufficient-but-low observation densities are notably poorer than those for other counties. We propose modeling at the larger scale of USDA farm resource regions (Fig. \ref{fig:FRR_map}), which are delineated in consideration of county-level, often cross-state similarities in geography and agricultural production (\cite{FRR2000}).

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

We find parcel-level climatic conditions and soil type, as well as county-level home values, contribute substantially to the model's predictive power. Our county-level model improves prediction error by X ppt and explanatory power ($R^2$) by Y ppt. By modeling at the FRR level, we extend coverage in areas that were dropped in county modeling due to insufficient density by 465 counties while preserving comparable predictive accuracy to county-level approaches. Together, these results suggest, first, that environmentally informed drivers of land market value constitute essential inputs into conservation cost models and, second, that modeling at broader scales while preserving relative homogeneity of market characteristics extends the capacity of such work. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data sources and methodology. Section 3 summarizes the results from both the county and FRR models, comparing their performance to that of Nolte (2020)'s approach. Section 4 discusses broader policy-relevant implications of the results. Section 5 concludes.


\section{Data and Methods}
We base our analysis on data first published by Nolte (2020), a comprehensive high-resolution dataset of parcel characteristics and sales across the contiguous United States (140.9 million properties across 3,055 counties), including variables on building presence, development, accessibility, local demographics, local nature preservation, terrain, water, flood risk, land cover type, location, and date of sale. To these base data, we add variables for soil quality, climate, irrigation status, and local real estate prices.

Soil classifications, indicating a map unit's suitability for agricultural use, were compiled from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)’s high-resolution SSURGO soil survey database (\cite{SoilSurveyStaffSoilStates}). The NRCS soil survey provides map unit polygons that describe soil components (e.g., ``loamy fine sand, 0 to 2 percent slopes") and characteristics, including water capacity, flooding frequency, farmland classification, and features limiting development, among others. Soil farmland classifications indicate a map unit's suitability for agriculture fall under five general classes, defined by the USDA:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Prime, optimal site composition and availability for producing agricultural product;  
    \item Unique, soil producing high-value crops (e.g., vineyards in California); 
    \item Statewide Importance, state-defined agricultural land that fails to meet prime criteria;
    \item Local importance, locally defined agricultural land that fails to meet prime or statewide criteria
    \item Conditional classes, land that would be considered prime, statewide importance, or local importance conditional on a specified improvement (e.g., ``Prime if drained and protected from flooding")
\end{enumerate}

Farmland classifications are operationalized as the percent of each parcel containing a given classification (e.g., ``Prime Farmland” or ``Farmland of Statewide Importance”). Aggregation is applied to overlapping classifications containing multiple conditions. For instance, ``Prime if drained or protected from flooding" gets assigned to ``Prime if drained" and ``Prime if protected from flooding." 

30-year, monthly climate normals of minimum, mean, and maximum temperature, as well as dew temperature and precipitation come from the PRISM Climate Group (\cite{PRISMClimate2021}). We aggregate these to the meteorological season. Parcel irrigation status is based on annual 1997-2017 estimates at a resolution of 30 sq. meters, produced by the Landsat-based Irrigation Dataset, or LANID-US (\cite{Xie2021MappingStates}). We create two binary irrigation variables to record 1) whether the parcel had ever been irrigated prior to sale, and 2) whether it was irrigated at any point in the 3 years immediately preceding the sale. 

To incorporate information on local real estate markets, we add yearly all-transaction house price index values at the county level (\cite{FederalHousing2022}). 

To focus our analysis on agricultural land value, we filter the ZTRAX data to only include parcels that are undeveloped, agricultural, or potentially agricultural (see Appendix for complete filtering criteria).
Our filter results in 5.26 million unique sales observations nationwide, split into testing (\textit{n = 1.47 million}) and training (\textit{n = 3.78 million}) sets stratified along the outcome variable (Fig. \ref{fig:train_test}). 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{archive/figures/test_train_density.png}
    \caption{Observation density by training and testing sets}
    \label{fig:train_test}
\end{figure}

With this expanded dataset, we model the fair market value of parcels--measured as logged per-hectare price, adjusted for inflation using monthly consumer price index (CPI) values (\cite{blsConsumerPrice})--using extremely randomized trees, a decision tree-based bagging algorithm. Extremely randomized trees are built with 500 base learners (trees), $\frac{p}{3}$ random features tried at each split, where $p$ is the total set of predictive features, and a required minimum leaf size of 3. We compare county and farm resource region performance on predictive accuracy, explanatory power, and variable importance. Following Nolte (2020), the county analysis is parallelized at the county level. Counties with fewer than 1000 observations are augmented with randomly sampled sales from adjacent counties until the focal county reaches 1000 observations. If the county and its neighbors combined fail to achieve 1000 complete observations, no model is specified. 1,571 county models are specified using this approach. We specify further models at each of the nine farm resource regions.

\section{Results}

We extend Nolte (2020)'s approach along two dimensions: added variables and extended spatial coverage. Below, results from each are summarized.

\subsection{Added Variables}

To Nolte's base county model (``Nolte"), we add variables on climatic conditions, soil type, and housing market values (``Full"). Figure \ref{fig:fcb_importance} shows the relative predictive contributions of each feature in the Full county model, where each dot represents a single county. The most impactful additions of this paper are the climatic variables (precipitation, dew temperature, and temperature) and housing price index (used in place of dollar values in the county models), followed by prime soil and soil of statewide importance, which is one productivity quality tier below prime. Irrigation status, both ever-irrigated and irrigated in the three years preceding the parcel's sale, contribute little predictive power, although both exhibit significant heterogeneity across counties. Conditional soil types (prime if warm enough, if protected, if irrigated, etc.) and smaller-scale importance, such as locally important soil types, offer little prediction importance to the model.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{exhibits/fcb_importance_all.png}
    \caption{Permutation feature importance from full county model. Features added by this paper denoted in bold.}
    \label{fig:fcb_importance}
\end{figure}

The added variables ameliorate specific limitations of the Nolte model. For instance, lacking a variable that tracks local real estate market trends over time, the Nolte model may be biased at the early and later ends of its sample range (2000-2019). Figure \ref{fig:nolte_resid_time} shows the effect of adding housing price index (HPI) data to the Nolte county model. While over-time heteroskedasticity remains even after the addition of HPI, the variable reduces the magnitude of the error, particularly the over-prediction in the early years of the sample and the under-prediction in its later years.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{exhibits/nolte_resid_time.png}
    \caption{Mean annual prediction error in Nolte base county model, compared to the addition of annual housing price index data at the county-level. Error bars represent one standard error.}
    \label{fig:nolte_resid_time}
\end{figure}

Our Full model offers modest but consistent improvements in model performance at the county level. Figure \ref{fig:county_compare_boxplot} shows the average county-level mean squared error and r-squared of the Full and Nolte models. Nationally, the Full model outperforms the Nolte model, with an average mean squared error (in logged 2020 \$ per hectare) of X compared to Nolte's Y and an average r-squared of X compared to Y.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{exhibits/county_compare_boxplot.png}
    \caption{Mean county-level model performance, Full compared to Nolte. Outliers removed for clarity.}
    \label{fig:county_compare_boxplot}
\end{figure}

National performance aggregations mask substantial heterogeneity across county characteristics. In particularly, a county's observation density is strongly correlated with both performance measures. Figure \ref{fig:compare_county_nobs_perf} shows the relationship between model performance and the total number of observations in the county where the model was trained and tested. The monotonicity of the decrease (increase) in mean squared error (r-squared) as county-level models increase in size affirms the intuitive benefits of greater sample sizes. In pursuit of larger datasets, however, analysts will encounter a fundamental challenge: expanding the sample size necessarily broadens the geographic range from which observations will be drawn. This may debilitate the model's predictive power if the broader geographic scope mixes land markets with disparate characteristics, economic dynamics, and time trends. Yet failing to expand the geographic scope has its own costs. In states such as Wyoming and Idaho, any given county has too few observations to model land value, forcing the analyst to discard perfectly good data.

    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{exhibits/compare_county_nobs_perf.png}
    \caption{County-level model performance against total observations in the county.}
    \label{fig:compare_county_nobs_perf}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Extended Coverage}

We attempt to solve this trade-off between model size and observation homogeneity by specifying models at the level of the farm resource region (Figure \ref{fig:FRR_map}). Note the spatial discontinuity of several regions, most notably the Fruitful Rim, which is scattered from the Pacific Northwest to Florida.

Specifying nine FRR-wide models enables the inclusion of observations that are dropped in county-level modeling. For example, Montana...

In the FRR models, such observations contribute to both training and testing. Figure \ref{fig:frr_test_density} shows the spatial distribution and density of observations used to evaluate FRR model performance. States like Montana and Wyoming, which are discarded from county models, are incorporated despite relatively low observation density. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{exhibits/frr_test_density.png}
    \caption{Testing set observation density by 10 km$^2$ hexagonal tessellation grid of the conterminous US}
    \label{fig:frr_test_density}
\end{figure}

Consistent with county-level findings, we observe that, across Nolte and Full predictor sets, FRR model prediction accuracy is greater in larger counties, even without controlling for the overall size of the FRR model (Figure \ref{fig:frr_compare_mse_size}). In counties with greater than 1,000 observations, the Full model produces an average mean squared of error of X. That figure grows Y in counties with fewer than 1,000 observations. Across both size categories, the Full model outperforms the Nolte model.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{exhibits/frr_compare_mse_size.png}
    \caption{frr mse by size}
    \label{fig:frr_compare_mse_size}
\end{figure}

The FRR models substantially improve spatial coverage while preserving overall predictive accuracy. In Figure \ref{fig:compare_ffb_fcb_mse}, we see that many states which are wholly absent from the county models receive predicted land values in the FRR model, including Montana, Maine, Idaho, Wyoming, Alabama, and Kansas. Several more states see their coverage greatly extended. In Missouri, for instance, the county models are only able to generate land value estimates in the urban and exurban regions surrounding St. Louis. The FRR models, by contrast, expand into the rural hinterland of Missouri, offering a broader array of land value predictions. Elsewhere, we see minor changes to coverage but improvements to predictive accuracy. In North Dakota, beyond the addition of several counties, the sparsely populated state benefits from its inclusion in the broader Northern Great Plains farm resource region. This allows North Dakota observations that would otherwise have been siloed off with only a handful of other observaations in their respective counties to be modeled alongside observations in segments of Wyoming, Montana, and Minnesota, among other states, which share agricultural and climatic characteristics.
